Organization of QuadPlots
-------------------------

Top Left: The trajectory of the Cassini spacecraft for the full day is represented by the blue line. The 10-min interval under investigation (03:00 to 03:10 UTC) is represented by the red circle. 

Top Right: Detrended Magnetic Field Components (B_r, B_θ, and B_ϕ). 

Bottom Left: Power Spectral Density of detrended data for all components of the magnetometer data and the 
compressional and transverse components of the wave magnitude. Ω_H2O+ is indicated by a solid blue line, while the criterion range (1/2·Ω_H2O+<f<2·Ω_H2O+) is indicated by dashed blue lines. The frequency with the highest power spectral density, f_max, is indicated by a vertical red line. 

Bottom Right: Discrete frequency calculation for all wave fragments in detrended data magnitude. The average peak-to-peak frequency, f_avg, is indicated by a solid red line, while the 1-σ range is indicated by the dashed red lines. The water gyrofrequency Ω_H2O+ is indicated by a solid blue line.
